# Research_Mixed_Data_Hierarchical_Clustering

Welcome to the GitHub repository dedicated to our innovative research on tackling the challenges of hierarchical clustering with mixed data types. In this repository, you will find all the essential code, tools, and resources to support and advance your understanding of hierarchical clustering in the context of mixed datasets.

Our research introduces advanced methodologies designed to improve the efficiency and accuracy of hierarchical clustering when dealing with datasets that contain both categorical and numerical features. This repository is intended to be a comprehensive resource for researchers, data scientists, and machine learning enthusiasts who are grappling with the complexities of mixed data clustering.

## Key Features
Within this repository, you’ll discover:

Implementation of Hierarchical Clustering Algorithms: Code for clustering algorithms specifically adapted for mixed data types, including enhancements to handle categorical and numerical features simultaneously.

Preprocessing Utilities: Tools for preprocessing and normalizing mixed datasets to ensure optimal clustering performance.

Evaluation Metrics: Scripts to calculate various evaluation metrics, including the Cophenetic Correlation Coefficient, Silhouette Score, Dunn Index, and others, tailored for hierarchical clustering of mixed data.

Sample Datasets: Example datasets that exhibit mixed features, provided to test and demonstrate the effectiveness of our clustering approach.

Comprehensive Documentation: Detailed documentation guiding you through the installation, implementation, and application of our hierarchical clustering techniques.

## Getting Started
### Installation
To get started, we recommend setting up a virtual environment (venv) to manage dependencies. Once your environment is ready, install the required packages using the following command:

bash
Copier le code
pip install -r requirements.txt
### Required Packages
Make sure your environment includes the following Python packages:

- pandas (version 2.2.1) : To handle mixed datasets and data manipulation.
- scipy (version 1.13.0) : For hierarchical clustering and other scientific computations.
- numpy (version 1.26.4) : For numerical operations and array management.
- networkx (version 3.3) : For graph manipulation and visualization.
- matplotlib (version 3.8.3) : For short visualization.
- seaborn (version 0.13.2) : For enhanced visualization.
- scikit-learn (version 1.4.2) : For machine learning algorithms and preprocessing.
Ensure your environment is properly configured to run the provided scripts and algorithms smoothly.

## How to Use This Repository
Preprocessing: Start by using the provided preprocessing scripts to prepare your mixed dataset for clustering. The scripts handle categorical encoding, normalization, and missing value imputation.

Clustering: Run the hierarchical clustering algorithms on your prepared dataset. You can experiment with different linkage criteria and distance metrics to observe their effects on the clustering output.

Evaluation: Use the evaluation scripts to assess the quality of your clustering results. The provided metrics will help you determine the optimal configuration for your specific dataset.

Explore and Innovate: Dive into the code, experiment with different datasets and configurations, and contribute your findings or enhancements to the repository.
